If you need proof of it, in this year of 2025, The White Stripes were officially inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame!</p><p>Jack White attended the event, although unsurprisingly Meg was staying out the spotlight and did not attend although Jack accepted the honour on her behalf and had actually spoke with her ahead of the ceremony to help him edit and fix up his speech.</p><p>Now obviously, you can't have an induction without the induction performance which wouldn't feel right if it was just Jack White. So they got the help of the genre-bending duo Twenty One Pilots to perform 2003's hit Seven Nation Army.</p><p>Now, I adore White Stripes and Twenty One Pilots. They're both incredibly great duos that perform their music with the energy that could rival a six-piece band. </p><p>In usual fashion, Twenty One Pilots don't just play the song chord for chord they do their own thing with it.</p><p>First, their appearance. Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun are both wearing these masks with these white stripes down, so they're officially Twenty One Pilots covering The White Stripes with White Stripes covering them which is just incredible in my opinion.</p><p>Tyler is wearing the usual sort of Clancy Tour outfit with the white t-shirt covered in the black ink, with Josh just being shirtless which is yeah, pretty much the usual.</p><p>Also, can I comment on how nice the drums look? It's got that red and black that's almost representive of The White Stripes and the Twenty One Pilots' Blurryface era.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://spaces.rocksound.tv/uploads/2025/11/Untitled-design-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="453" data-is-external-image="true"><figcaption>Picture of Twenty One Pilots performing Seven Nation Army by The White Stripes.</figcaption></figure><p>And now second, the performance, while I do want to first go off and say. The Disney+ mix sounds like actual shit, I get that it was live but wow. There's phone recordings of them playing that sounds better.</p><p>But anyway, they play the bass and drums for the majority which is a good. I will say I do feel like Tyler's vocals were just a little underwhelming for what I expected, but hey I still enjoyed it. Then we get to verse 3, Josh moves over to the keyboard and puts down these synth chords while Tyler plays the piano and sings the verse before they both switch back and do the pre-chorus with Tyler delivering that amazing scream which I honestly wish there was more of.</p><p>All in all, incredible performance! If you want to check it out, a video of the performance is below. I know this isn't the usual post but I thought I'd talk about it.</p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZalaNygEwzs?si=UYxKRLDbNKodYo98" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on November 16, 2025</p><div class="post__share"></div></footer><nav class="pagination"><div class="pagination__title"><span>Read other posts</span></div><div class="pagination__buttons"><a href="https://humbugpost.judekerr.com/beatdj-multiplayer-2025/" class="btn previous" rel="prev" aria-label="[MISSING TRANSLATION]:  The Worldwide Music Coding Session - BeatDJ Multiplayer "><span class="btn__icon">←</span> <span class="btn__text">The Worldwide Music Coding Session - BeatDJ Multiplayer</span></a></div></nav></article><div class="post__comments"><div class="comments"><div class="comments-wrapper"><h2>Comments</h2><div id="graphcomment"></div><noscript>Please enable JS to use the comments form.</noscript><script type="text/javascript">var __semio__params = {
